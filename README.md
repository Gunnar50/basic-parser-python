# Basic Parser in Python

My first attempt to create a programming language parser using python.

## How to use

The only requirement at the moment is Python 3 or above.

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Gunnar50/basic-parser-python.git
```

Move into the directory:

```
cd basic-parser-python
```

Run the main.py file

```
python main.py
```
